# CV-Application

## Description
This project is a CV builder that allows a user to build a CV by adding information into the form on the application. This project was built for the purpose of learning ReactJS.
* [Live demo](https://adkenney.github.io/CV-Application/)
## What I Learned
Over the course of this project I first learned how to implement the application using class components and then switching over to functional components with hooks to add state. I also decided to try Material-UI for the first time to help style the react components used in the application.
## Built With
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
## Credit
This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full-stack javascript course.
